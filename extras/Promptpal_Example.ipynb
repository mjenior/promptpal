      "\n",
      "    *   **Technical improvements:**\n",
      "        *   **Type Hints:** Added type hints for function arguments and return values to improve code readability and help with static analysis.\n",
      "        *   **String Formatting:** Used f-strings for more readable and efficient string formatting.\n",
      "        *   **Error Handling:** Added a check for malformed lines in the BLAST output.\n",
      "        *   **File Handling:** Used `with open(...)` for proper file resource management.\n",
      "        *   **String Operations:** Replaced `str(line)[0]` with `line.startswith('>')` for efficiency and readability. Removed unnecessary `str()` calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Architectural improvements:**\n",
      "        *   **Modularization:** Divided the code into functions (`parse_blast_output`, `annotate_fasta`, `write_log_file`, `main`) to improve organization and reusability.\n",
      "        *   **Main Function:** Encapsulated the main execution logic within a `main` function and used the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Interpretability improvements:**\n",
      "        *   **Clearer Variable Names:** Used more descriptive variable names.\n",
      "        *   **Comments and Docstrings:** Added comprehensive comments and docstrings to explain the purpose of each function and section of code.\n",
      "        *   **Removed Redundancies:** Eliminated redundant string conversions and operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Documentation enhancements:**\n",
      "        *   Added a detailed docstring to the top of the script explaining its usage.\n",
      "        *   Added docstrings to each function explaining its purpose, arguments, and return values.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Performance Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Time Complexity:** The overall time complexity remains largely the same, as the core algorithms are unchanged. However, the use of more efficient string operations and the `enumerate` function may provide minor performance improvements.\n",
      "    *   **Memory Usage:** Memory usage should be similar, although the use of dictionaries could potentially consume more memory for large BLAST output files.\n",
      "    *   **Potential Bottlenecks Addressed:** The check for malformed BLAST lines prevents potential errors and improves robustness.  The use of `line.startswith('>')` is slightly more efficient than `str(line)[0] == '>'`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Future Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Scalability:** For very large FASTA files, consider using generators or other techniques to process the file in chunks to reduce memory consumption.\n",
      "    *   **Maintenance:** The modular design and comprehensive documentation make the code easier to maintain and extend.\n",
      "    *   **Modern Alternatives:** Consider using libraries like `Biopython` for FASTA file parsing and sequence manipulation, which could provide more robust and feature-rich functionality. For BLAST parsing, dedicated libraries can handle various BLAST output formats more reliably.\n",
      "    *   **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling, such as try-except blocks for file I/O operations and more specific exception handling for different potential errors.\n",
      "    *   **Command-Line Argument Parsing:** Use the `argparse` module for more robust and user-friendly command-line argument parsing.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Lesson Title:** Understanding Refactored Python Code and Unit Testing\n",
      "\n",
      "**Learning Objective:** By the end of this lesson, the beginner coder will understand the core principles of code modularization, type hinting, error handling, and unit testing in Python, as demonstrated in the `annotate_fasta.py` example.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Time Check: Introduction (2 minutes)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Briefly explain the context: We're looking at a refactored Python script that annotates FASTA files using BLAST output. The original code was improved for readability, maintainability, and testability.\n",
      "*   Highlight the key improvements: Modularization, type hints, f-strings, error handling, and unit testing.\n",
      "*   State the goal: To understand how these principles make code better.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Time Check: Main Content (10 minutes)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Teaching Point 1: Modularization (3 minutes)**\n",
      "    *   Explain: Modularization means breaking down a large program into smaller, manageable functions.\n",
      "    *   Example: In `annotate_fasta.py`, we have functions like `parse_blast_output`, `annotate_fasta`, `write_log_file`, and `main`.\n",
      "    *   Why it's good:\n",
      "        *   **Readability:** Easier to understand each function's purpose.\n",
      "        *   **Reusability:** Functions can be reused in other parts of the code or in other programs.\n",
      "        *   **Testability:** Easier to test individual functions.\n",
      "    *   Key concept: **Function decomposition** - breaking down a complex problem into smaller, independent sub-problems.\n",
      "*   **Teaching Point 2: Type Hints and Error Handling (4 minutes)**\n",
      "    *   Explain: Type hints specify the expected data types for function arguments and return values (e.g., `def parse_blast_output(blast_file: str) -> dict:`).\n",
      "    *   Explain: Error handling involves anticipating and gracefully managing potential problems in the code (e.g., checking for malformed input files).\n",
      "    *   Example: The script uses type hints to clarify what each function expects and returns. It also includes `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors like missing files or invalid data formats.\n",
      "    *   Why it's good:\n",
      "        *   **Type Hints:** Improve code readability and help catch type-related errors early on.\n",
      "        *   **Error Handling:** Prevents the program from crashing and provides informative error messages.\n",
      "    *   Key concept: **Defensive programming** - writing code that anticipates and handles potential problems.\n",
      "*   **Teaching Point 3: Unit Testing (3 minutes)**\n",
      "    *   Explain: Unit tests are small, isolated tests that verify the correctness of individual functions or units of code.\n",
      "    *   Example: The `unittest` module is used to create test cases for each function in `annotate_fasta.py`.\n",
      "    *   Why it's good:\n",
      "        *   **Ensures Correctness:** Verifies that the code works as expected.\n",
      "        *   **Facilitates Refactoring:** Allows you to make changes to the code with confidence that you haven't broken anything.\n",
      "        *   **Provides Documentation:** Serves as a form of documentation, showing how the code is intended to be used.\n",
      "    *   Key concept: **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - writing tests before writing the code itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Time Check: Conclusion (2 minutes)**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Recap: We learned about modularization, type hints, error handling, and unit testing.\n",
      "*   Emphasize: These principles are crucial for writing robust, maintainable, and testable code.\n",
      "*   Encourage: Practice applying these principles in your own projects.\n",
