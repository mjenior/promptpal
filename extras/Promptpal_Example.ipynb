      "\n",
      "* **Docstrings:** Comprehensive docstrings have been added to the script and each function.  This clearly explains the purpose, arguments, and return values.  This addresses the original request for thorough documentation.\n",
      "* **Conciseness:**  The code has been significantly shortened by using more Pythonic idioms and removing unnecessary steps.\n",
      "* **Error Handling:** Added `try...except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError` and other exceptions, providing more informative error messages and preventing the script from crashing.  A check for lines with insufficient fields in the BLAST output is also included.\n",
      "* **Clearer Variable Names:** More descriptive variable names have been used (e.g., `blast_dictionary` instead of `blast_dict`).\n",
      "* **f-strings:**  Used f-strings for string formatting, making the code more readable and efficient.\n",
      "* **Pathlib:** The `pathlib` module is used for handling file paths in a more robust and platform-independent way.  This also cleans up how output file names are generated. Replaced the clunky `.rstrip('fastn')` with `Path(...).with_suffix(...)`.\n",
      "* **Function Decomposition:** The code is now organized into functions, making it more modular, readable, and reusable.  Specifically, `parse_blast_output`, `annotate_fasta`, `write_log_file`, and `write_output` are separated functions.  The `main` function orchestrates the process.\n",
      "* **Removed Unnecessary String Conversions:** Removed redundant `str()` conversions where they were not needed.\n",
      "* **Context Managers:** Using `with open(...)` ensures files are properly closed, even if errors occur.\n",
      "* **Meaningful Log Messages:** The log messages are more informative.\n",
      "* **Main Block:** Encapsulated the main execution logic within a `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block. This is standard practice in Python.\n",
      "* **Argument Validation:** Added a check to ensure the correct number of command-line arguments are provided.\n",
      "* **Return Values:** The `annotate_fasta` function now returns both the annotated sequences *and* the annotation stats, making the code cleaner and the stats readily available for logging.\n",
      "* **Line Endings:** Explicitly add `\\n` when writing to the FASTA and log files to ensure proper formatting.\n",
      "* **Removed Redundant Code:** Eliminated duplicate code and simplified logic.\n",
      "* **Shebang:** Added a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) to make the script executable directly.\n",
      "* **Sequence Handling**: Now correctly handles multi-line FASTA sequences, fixing a critical bug in the original code.  The code iterates until the next header or the end of the file to collect the sequence.\n",

      "* **Edge Cases:** The tests include edge cases such as empty files, missing BLAST hits, incomplete lines in the BLAST output, and hypothetical/unknown annotations.\n",
      "* **Mocking:**  `unittest.mock.patch` is used extensively to mock file operations. This allows the tests to run without needing actual files.  This makes the tests fast and independent of the file system.  Specifically, `mock_open` creates a mock file object.\n",
      "* **Assertions:** The tests use `self.assertEqual`, `self.assertIn`, and other assertion methods to verify that the functions produce the expected results.\n",
      "* **Main Function Testing:** The `test_main_valid_execution` test checks the overall flow of the `main` function. It mocks the command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) and checks if the correct files are opened and the expected messages are printed to standard output.  `test_main_file_not_found_error` tests error handling in `main`.\n",
      "* **StringIO for stdout Capture:** `io.StringIO` is used in conjunction with `unittest.mock.patch` to capture standard output (`sys.stdout`). This allows us to assert what the `main` function prints to the console.\n",
      "* **Argument Validation Testing**: The `test_main_invalid_arguments` function confirms that `main` handles incorrect command-line arguments correctly. It validates that the correct usage message is printed to stdout, and the program exits with an error code.\n",

If not available, discuss common readability pitfalls.\n",
      "    *   **Activity 2 (60 mins):**  Walkthrough the refactored `annotate_fasta.py` script.  Discuss:\n",
      "        *   **Docstrings:** Emphasize the purpose and structure of docstrings for explaining functions and modules.  (Example: `help(annotate_fasta.parse_blast_output)`)\n",

      "        *   **`unittest.mock.patch` and `mock_open`:**  Explain how mocking is used to isolate the code being tested from external dependencies (e.g., file I/O).  Demonstrate how `patch` replaces functions/classes with mock objects.  Emphasize that we are testing the *logic* of our code, not whether external files exist or are formatted correctly.\n",
